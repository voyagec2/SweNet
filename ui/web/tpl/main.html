    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
        XLore contains 10,856,042 different instances, integrated from English Wikipedia, Chinese Wikipedia, Hudong Baike and Baidu Baike. The instances are connected together with different general properties and infobox properties. They are connected with the class taxonomy by two properties: instanceOf (is-a) and iSubTopicOf (not-is-a). We believe iSubTopicOf should be the noise in the online wikis. Thus we distinguish it with instanceOf and keep it in XLore to harvest more relatedness information.
